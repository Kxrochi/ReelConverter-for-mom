# 🔧 Railway Deployment - Fixed Configuration

## The Issue
Railway was failing because of nixpacks configuration errors with package names.

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Fixed nixpacks.toml (Recommended)

The current `nixpacks.toml` has been fixed:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python3", "nodejs"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "pip install yt-dlp",
  "npm install"
]

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

### Option 2: Use Dockerfile (If nixpacks fails)

If nixpacks continues to fail, rename `Dockerfile.railway` to `Dockerfile`:

```bash
# Rename the backup Dockerfile
mv Dockerfile.railway Dockerfile

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Use Dockerfile instead of nixpacks"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

1. **Push the fixed configuration:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix nixpacks configuration for Railway"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway:**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click "Redeploy" or push new changes
   - Should now work with the fixed nixpacks.toml

3. **If it still fails:**
   - Use Option 2 above to switch to Dockerfile
   - Railway will automatically detect and use the Dockerfile

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

- ❌ **Before**: `nixPkgs = ["python311", "nodejs_18", "npm"]`
- ✅ **After**: `nixPkgs = ["python3", "nodejs"]`

The issue was:
- `npm` is not a valid nixpkg (it comes with nodejs)
- `python311` and `nodejs_18` might not be available in all nixpkgs versions
- `python3` and `nodejs` are more standard package names

## 📊 Expected Build Process

With the fixed configuration, Railway will:
1. ✅ Install Python 3
2. ✅ Install Node.js (includes npm)
3. ✅ Install yt-dlp via pip
4. ✅ Install npm dependencies
5. ✅ Start the application

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Try the Dockerfile approach** as a fallback
3. **Contact Railway support** if both approaches fail

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when you see:
- ✅ Build completes without nixpacks errors
- ✅ App starts and shows "Server is running"
- ✅ Health check at `/health` returns 200
- ✅ You can access the web interface

**Ready to deploy! 🚀**
