# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Dockerfile Issues

The Dockerfile has been updated to fix the deployment issues you encountered. Here's what was changed:

### 🔧 **Dockerfile Fixes:**

1. **Changed base image** from `python:3.11-slim` to `node:18-slim`
2. **Fixed curl issue** by installing curl before using it
3. **Simplified installation** process
4. **Added proper Python3 support** for cloud environments

### 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Dockerfile for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway:**
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" on your project
   - Or Railway will auto-deploy from your Git push

3. **Alternative: Use Nixpacks (Recommended):**
   - Railway will automatically detect the `nixpacks.toml` file
   - This avoids Docker issues entirely
   - More reliable for Node.js + Python apps

### 📁 **Files Updated:**

- `Dockerfile` - Fixed for Railway deployment
- `nixpacks.toml` - Alternative deployment method
- `server.js` - Updated for cloud Python detection

### 🔍 **What the Fix Does:**

1. **Uses Node.js base image** (more reliable)
2. **Installs Python3** and pip3
3. **Installs yt-dlp** via pip3
4. **Handles both python and python3** commands
5. **Optimized for Railway's environment**

### 🚂 **Railway-Specific Configuration:**

Railway will now:
- ✅ Detect Node.js automatically
- ✅ Install Python3 and yt-dlp
- ✅ Build successfully
- ✅ Deploy your app globally

### 🌐 **After Successful Deployment:**

Your app will be available at:
- `https://your-app.railway.app`
- Accessible from anywhere in the world
- Works on any device with internet

### 🆘 **If Deployment Still Fails:**

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific errors
2. **Try the Nixpacks method** (Railway will use `nixpacks.toml`)
3. **Verify all files are committed** to Git
4. **Check environment variables** in Railway dashboard

### 📱 **Testing After Deployment:**

1. **Open the Railway URL** in your browser
2. **Try downloading** an Instagram reel
3. **Check if yt-dlp** is working
4. **Test from your phone** (any network)

### 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ App loads successfully
- ✅ QR code shows global URL
- ✅ Downloads work from anywhere
- ✅ Mobile access from any network
